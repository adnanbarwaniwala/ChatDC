# ChatDC
**ChatDC** is a **chatbot** for my school **Daly College (DC), Indore**. It uses the `llama-3.1-70b-versatile` LLM along with the `Chroma` vector database to answer user queries about my school. This repository contains all the project code and code for its **GUI**. 

**Note:** *As I update the project, I'll create different versions. Currently, the first version of the project `v1` is available and I'm working on `v2`, the second version. The code for each version can be found in their relevant directories.* 

## Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:
### v1 Directory - First Version of the Project

- **vector_dc_info/**: This folder contains the vector database used in the project. It stores the vectorized information for the school database.
- **dc_info.txt**: A text file containing all the information about the school.
- **v1_functions.py**: This script includes all the functions used in the project.
- **v1_gui.py**: This script contains the code for the GUI (Graphical User Interface) of the project.


## Working
- Enter the query using the GUI built with `streamlit`
- Similarity search is carried out with the contents of the vector database
- The question, along with the most similar chunks, are appended to a prompt sent to the LLM
- The LLM generates a response

## Additional Features
- History of previous conversations is provided to the LLM to maintain conversational context.
- The history of all the previous interactions is visible in GUI.

## Further Improvements
- Expanding the information about DC in the database
- Building `v2` of ChatDC using LangGraph and LangChain agents.
